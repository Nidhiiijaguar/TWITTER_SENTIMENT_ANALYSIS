#TWITTER RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM
About the Project:
The aim of this project is to build a recommendation sytem that can help an organization to target their customers based on their specific interests. This can help the organization in forming effective marketing strategies to attract customers. Users interests are gathered from their twitter account in the form of tweets, favorites etc. For collecting data we used tweepy API to extract tweets, favorites etc. Then we classified the users interests into relevant categories with an accuracy of about 85% by using nlp algorithms. We also performed sentiment analysis of tweets, retweets and were able to achieve an accuracy of 90%. Individual user interesta are displayed using pie chart built using matplotlib whereas overall user interests are displayed using bar graph built using bokeh.
